    Analyze the pull request and write routing decision to router_decision.json.

    **MANDATORY STEPS (complete ALL steps)**:

    1. **Read PR metadata** - Call WorkspaceTool to read diff.json 2. **Read PR
    diff** - Call WorkspaceTool to read diff.txt 3. **Read commits** - Call
    WorkspaceTool to read commits.json 4. **Analyze complexity** - Determine PR
    complexity and required workflows 5. **Write decision file** - Call
    WorkspaceTool to write router_decision.json

    **IMPORTANT**: GitHub Actions has ALREADY prepared these files: -
    `diff.txt`: Full PR diff (base..head) with ALL code changes -
    `commits.json`: All commits in this PR with stats - `diff.json`: PR metadata
    (number, labels, files changed, additions/deletions)

    You do NOT fetch from GitHub APIs - files are ready to read.

    **STEP 1: Read Input Files**

    Use WorkspaceTool to read each file: - Read diff.json → get pr_number,
    commit_sha, labels, files_changed, additions, deletions - Read diff.txt →
    analyze file types, patterns, security concerns - Read commits.json → review
    commit messages, authors, stats

    **STEP 2: Analyze PR Complexity**

    Based on the data: - Count files changed and lines modified - Identify file
    types: code, tests, config, docs, legal - Detect security-sensitive files:
    .env*, *secret*, *key*, auth*, credential* - Assess complexity: LOW (< 5
    files, < 100 lines) / MEDIUM (5-20 files, 100-500 lines) / HIGH (> 20 files
    OR > 500 lines)

    **STEP 3: Decide Workflows**

    Determine which workflows to run: - **ALWAYS include**: ["ci-log-analysis",
    "quick-review"] (default baseline) - **IF** "crewai:full-review" label
    exists → add "full-review" to workflows - **IF** "crewai:legal" label exists
    → add "legal-review" to workflows

    **STEP 4: Generate Suggestions**

    Suggest labels if patterns detected: - IF files_changed > 20 OR
    lines_changed > 500 → suggest "crewai:full-review" - IF legal files detected
    (LICENSE*, TERMS*, PRIVACY*, CONTRIBUTING*) → suggest "crewai:legal" - IF
    security files detected (.env*, *secret*, *key*, auth*) → WARN immediately -
    IF only tests modified → suggest reviewing test coverage - IF only docs
    changed → note quick review may be sufficient

    **STEP 5: Write Output File (CRITICAL)**

    Call WorkspaceTool to write router_decision.json with this structure:
    ```json {
      "workflows": ["ci-log-analysis", "quick-review"],
      "suggestions": ["suggestion text here"],
      "metadata": {
        "pr_number": 123,
        "commit_sha": "abc123",
        "files_changed": 5,
        "lines_added": 100,
        "lines_removed": 50,
        "complexity": "MEDIUM"
      },
      "analysis": {
        "complexity": "MEDIUM",
        "reason": "5-20 files changed",
        "file_types_detected": ["python", "yaml"],
        "security_files_detected": false
      }
    } ```

    **OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS**: - workflows: Array (MUST include
    "ci-log-analysis" and "quick-review") - suggestions: Array of strings -
    metadata: Object with pr_number, commit_sha, files_changed, lines_added,
    lines_removed, complexity - analysis: Object with complexity, reason,
    file_types_detected, security_files_detected

    **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**: - [ ] Did you call WorkspaceTool with
    operation="write"? - [ ] Did you set filename="router_decision.json"? - [ ]
    Does content include all 4 required fields: workflows, suggestions,
    metadata, analysis? - [ ] Does workflows array include both
    "ci-log-analysis" and "quick-review"? - [ ] Is complexity one of: LOW,
    MEDIUM, HIGH?

    **CRITICAL**: - You MUST call WorkspaceTool to write router_decision.json -
    DO NOT return JSON as text - it must be written to a file - DO NOT use
    ACTION/INPUT text formatting - directly call the tool - Your final answer
    must confirm the file was written

  expected_output: >
    Confirmation message stating: "Successfully wrote router_decision.json to
    workspace."

    The file MUST exist in workspace with: - workflows array (always includes
    ci-log-analysis and quick-review) - suggestions array based on PR analysis -
    metadata object with PR details - analysis object with complexity assessment

    The router_decision.json file will be read by subsequent agents to
    understand workflow decisions.
