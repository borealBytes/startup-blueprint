synthesize_summary:
  description: >
    Synthesize all review outputs into a final GitHub-flavored markdown summary.

    **YOUR TASK**: Read workspace files and create a comprehensive summary.

    WORKSPACE FILES TO READ (use WorkspaceTool):
    1. `router_decision.json` - Router suggestions
    2. `ci_summary.json` - CI analysis (REQUIRED)
    3. `quick_review.json` - Quick code review
    4. `full_review.json` - Full technical review (if available)
    5. `diff.txt` - Commit diff (if available)

    **IMPORTANT**: Use WorkspaceTool to read each file. If a file doesn't exist,
    that's OK - just skip it and note "Not available" in your summary.

    EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
    ```
    Step 1: Read ci_summary.json using WorkspaceTool (operation="read", filename="ci_summary.json")
    Step 2: Read quick_review.json using WorkspaceTool
    Step 3: Try to read full_review.json - if empty, mark as "Did not run"
    Step 4: Synthesize findings into markdown
    Step 5: Write final_summary.md using WorkspaceTool (operation="write", filename="final_summary.md", content=<your markdown>)
    ```

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. DO NOT wrap output in ```markdown blocks
    2. Use ## for main headings, ### for subheadings
    3. Keep it concise - max 30 lines total
    4. If a file is missing, just say "Did not run" - don't error
    5. Focus on ci_summary.json as the primary data source

  expected_output: >
