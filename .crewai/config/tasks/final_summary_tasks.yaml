synthesize_summary:
  description: >
    YOU MUST synthesize all review outputs into comprehensive GitHub markdown
    with ALL findings in collapsible HTML <details> sections.

    **CRITICAL**: This is NOT a summary task. You must show EVERY finding with
    full details. DO NOT abbreviate or skip findings.

    **EXECUTION STEPS** (follow exactly):

    1. **Read CI Summary**:
       ```
       WorkspaceTool(operation="read", filename="ci_summary.json", content="")
       ```
       - Extract `critical_errors` array (show ALL errors, not count)
       - Extract `warnings` array (show ALL warnings)
       - Extract `summary`, `status`, `checks_performed`
       - If file missing/empty: note "CI analysis not available"

    2. **Read Quick Review** (MOST IMPORTANT):
       ```
       WorkspaceTool(operation="read", filename="quick_review.json", content="")
       ```
       - Extract arrays: `critical`, `warnings`, `info`
       - **YOU MUST iterate through EVERY item** in each array
       - For EACH item extract: `title`, `file`, `line`, `description`,
    `fix_suggestion`
       - Count totals but also SHOW each finding
       - If file missing/empty: note "Quick review not available"

    3. **Read Full Review** (if exists):
       ```
       WorkspaceTool(operation="read", filename="full_review.json", content="")
       ```
       - Extract high/critical severity findings only
       - If missing: note "Did not run"

    4. **Read Router Decision**:
       ```
       WorkspaceTool(operation="read", filename="router_decision.json",
    content="")
       ```
       - Extract `suggestions` array

    5. **Write Complete Markdown**:
       ```
       WorkspaceTool(operation="write", filename="final_summary.md",
    content="<markdown_here>")
       ```

    **OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS**:

    Use this EXACT structure with actual data from the JSON files:

    ```markdown
    ## ⚠️ Review Summary

    Review completed for PR #(pr_number) - (count) workflows executed.

    **Commit**: `(commit_sha)`
    **Repository**: (repository)
    **Workflows**: (workflows)

    **VALIDATION BEFORE WRITING**:
    ✓ Counted `critical` array length from quick_review.json
    ✓ Counted `warnings` array length
    ✓ Counted `info` array length
    ✓ Iterated through EACH item in EACH array
    ✓ Formatted each finding with title, file:line, description, fix
    ✓ Used `<details open>` for critical (expanded)
    ✓ Used `<details>` for warnings/suggestions (collapsed)
    ✓ Replaced ALL placeholders with actual data from JSON files
    ✓ Final markdown is 1500+ characters (comprehensive)

    **COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID**:
    ❌ Writing "5 critical issues found" without listing them
    ❌ Using placeholders like "show all critical issues" instead of actual list
    ❌ Summarizing findings instead of showing each one
    ❌ Forgetting to call WorkspaceTool("write", "final_summary.md", ...)
    ❌ Writing markdown less than 1000 characters (means you skipped findings)

    **REMEMBER**: Your job is to format and display data, not summarize it. Read
    the JSON files and present EVERY finding in proper markdown format.

  expected_output: >
    Comprehensive GitHub-flavored markdown file saved as final_summary.md with
    minimum 1500 characters. Must contain ALL findings from quick_review.json
    displayed in collapsible <details> sections with title, file path, line
    number, description, and fix suggestion for EACH finding. Critical issues
    expanded by default, warnings/suggestions collapsed.
