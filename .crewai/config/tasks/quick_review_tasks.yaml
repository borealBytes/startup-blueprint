    EXECUTE EXACTLY 2 TOOL CALLS IN THIS ORDER:

    TOOL CALL 1 (required):
    WorkspaceTool(operation="read", filename="diff.json", content="")
    Extract: files_changed, additions, deletions, pr_number, commit_sha

    TOOL CALL 2 (required):
    WorkspaceTool(operation="write", filename="quick_review.json", content={...})

    Required content for TOOL CALL 2:
    {
      "status": "success",
      "passed": true,
      "summary": "Quick metadata review complete",
      "critical": [],
      "warnings": [],
      "info": ["Reviewed [N] files, [M] lines changed"],
      "files_reviewed": [N],
      "total_findings": 0,
      "suggestions": []
    }

    Add to suggestions array if:
    - additions + deletions > 500: {"title": "Large PR", "description": "Consider crewai:full-review label"}
    - files_changed > 20: {"title": "Many files", "description": "Consider crewai:full-review label"}

    RULES:
    - Make BOTH tool calls before returning anything
    - DO NOT explain what you will do
    - DO NOT return text between tool calls
    - DO NOT read diff.txt (causes token overflow)
    - Your final answer is ONLY the verification message below

  expected_output: |
    Verify both conditions:
    1. Tool call 1 completed (read diff.json)
    2. Tool call 2 completed (wrote quick_review.json)

    If BOTH true, return: "Quick review complete: [N] files, [M] lines"
    If either false, return: "ERROR: Tool call [X] failed"
