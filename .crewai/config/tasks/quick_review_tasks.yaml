    **TASK**: Perform fast code quality review focusing on common issues and
    best practices.

    **INPUTS AVAILABLE**: - diff.txt (full PR diff) - commits.json (commit
    history) - diff.json (PR metadata)

    **YOUR ANALYSIS STEPS**:

    1. **Read PR diff** using WorkspaceTool:
       ```
       WorkspaceTool(operation="read", filename="diff.txt", content="")
       ```
       Parse the unified diff format to extract file changes

    2. **Analyze each changed file** for:

       **Code Quality**:
       - Overly complex logic (nested loops, long methods)
       - Magic numbers/strings without constants
       - Duplicate code patterns
       - Missing error handling
       - Poor naming conventions

       **Best Practices**:
       - Missing documentation for public APIs
       - Hardcoded credentials or secrets
       - Console.log/print statements left in code
       - TODO/FIXME comments without tracking
       - Missing input validation

       **Performance Red Flags**:
       - N+1 query patterns
       - Unnecessary loops or iterations
       - Missing database indexes
       - Inefficient data structures

       **Security Concerns**:
       - SQL injection vulnerabilities
       - Unvalidated user input
       - Exposed sensitive data
       - Missing authentication checks

    3. **Categorize findings** by severity:
       - 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, breaking
    changes
       - 🟡 **WARNING**: Code quality issues, missing docs, potential bugs
       - 🔵 **INFO**: Style suggestions, minor improvements, best practices

    4. **Return JSON output** in this EXACT structure:
       {
         "status": "warning",  # success, warning, or critical
         "passed": false,
         "summary": "Found 2 critical issues and 5 warnings",
         "critical": [
           {
             "title": "SQL Injection Vulnerability",
             "file": "api/users.py",
             "line": "45",
             "description": "User input concatenated directly into SQL query
    without sanitization",
             "fix_suggestion": "Use parameterized queries or ORM instead of
    string concatenation"
           }
         ],
         "warnings": [
           {
             "title": "Missing Error Handling",
             "file": "utils/parser.ts",
             "line": "128",
             "description": "File read operation without try-catch block",
             "fix_suggestion": "Add try-catch to handle file not found or
    permission errors"
           }
         ],
         "info": [
           {
             "title": "Magic Number",
             "file": "config/settings.py",
             "line": "12",
             "description": "Hardcoded timeout value of 3000ms",
             "fix_suggestion": "Extract to named constant:
    REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS = 3000"
           }
         ],
         "files_reviewed": 5,
         "total_findings": 8
       }

    **IMPORTANT**: - Focus on NEW/CHANGED code only (lines starting with `+` in
    diff) - Ignore formatting/style if CI handles it - Provide specific line
    numbers from the diff - Every finding MUST have a concrete fix suggestion -
    Be concise - this is a "quick" review

  expected_output: >
    JSON object with categorized findings (critical/warning/info) including file
    paths, line numbers, issue descriptions, and specific fix suggestions.
