parse_and_contextualize:
  description: >
    Parse the diff and commits to create structured context. Read diff.txt and
    commits.json, then create a JSON analysis with: - commit_intent: summary of
    what changed - total_changes: number of lines added/deleted - changed_files:
    list of files with path, type (modified/added/deleted), additions,
    deletions, risk_level - review_focus_areas: list like ["security",
    "database", "config"] - sampled_diff: the actual diff content to review
    Return ONLY valid JSON matching this structure.
  expected_output: 'Valid JSON with diff analysis'

detect_code_issues:
  description: >
    Analyze the diff context and identify code issues. Look for: - Security
    issues (SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, eval/exec) - Performance issues
    (N+1 queries, nested loops, missing pagination) - Quality issues (magic
    numbers, poor error handling, duplicate code) Return JSON with three arrays:
    critical[], warnings[], info[] Each issue should have: file, line,
    code_snippet, description If no issues found, return empty arrays.
  expected_output: 'Valid JSON with issues array'

synthesize_report:
  description: >
    Create the final review report from diff context and code issues. Combine
    all findings into a comprehensive review with: - status: "ok", "warning", or
    "critical" - summary: detailed review summary (minimum 100 characters) -
    total_findings: total number of issues - critical[]: array of critical
    issues with file, line, code_snippet, description, fix_suggestion -
    warnings[]: array of warnings with same structure - info[]: array of
    informational notes - merge_status: "APPROVE", "REQUEST_CHANGES", or
    "NEEDS_DISCUSSION" - merge_rationale: explanation for the merge decision
    Return ONLY valid JSON.
  expected_output: 'Valid JSON with complete review'
