    EXECUTE these 2 mandatory steps. DO NOT stop after step 1. DO NOT describe what you will do - DO IT.


    STEP 1: Read diff.txt and identify issues
    
    Use WorkspaceTool(operation="read", filename="diff.txt", content="") to get code changes.
    
    Analyze for: critical security issues, code quality problems, performance issues, best practice violations.
    
    Focus ONLY on lines starting with + (new code).


    STEP 2: Write quick_review.json with findings
    
    Use WorkspaceTool(operation="write", filename="quick_review.json", content=<json_object>)
    
    Required JSON structure:
    {
      "status": "success|warning|critical",
      "passed": true|false,
      "summary": "Brief text",
      "critical": [{title, file, line, description, fix_suggestion}],
      "warnings": [],
      "info": [],
      "files_reviewed": N,
      "total_findings": N
    }
    
    If no issues: status="success", passed=true, empty arrays.
    If issues found: categorize by severity (critical/warning/info).


    CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
    - BOTH steps MUST complete
    - DO NOT return text like "I will..." - EXECUTE the actions
    - DO NOT stop after reading diff.txt
    - You MUST call WorkspaceTool twice: once to read, once to write
    - The task is NOT complete until quick_review.json exists in workspace

  expected_output: >
    "Successfully wrote quick_review.json with N findings (C critical, W warnings, I info)."
    
    The file MUST physically exist in workspace directory.
