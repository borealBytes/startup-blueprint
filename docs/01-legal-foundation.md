# 1. Legal Foundation ⚜️

**Executive Summary**: Register your business as an LLC, get your EIN, and establish legal compliance. Time: 2-3 hours. Cost: $50-150.

---

## Why This Matters

### Liability Protection
Your LLC separates your personal assets from business liabilities. If BUSINESS NAME gets sued, your personal bank account is protected.

### Tax Efficiency
LLCs offer pass-through taxation (no double taxation) and flexibility. You pay taxes on personal return.

### Professionalism
Banks, investors, and partners take you more seriously with a registered entity.

### Compliance
Certain activities require a registered business (licensing, contracts, hiring).

**This guide recommends: LLC**

Why?
- Simple to set up
- Automatic liability protection
- Pass-through taxation (no double tax)
- Flexible for adding members later
- Can later convert to C-Corp if needed

## Step 1: Finalize Your Business Name

### Requirements

Most states require:
- Must end in "LLC" or "L.L.C."
- Cannot be identical to existing registered businesses
- Cannot contain prohibited words (usually "bank", "insurance", etc.)

### Availability Check

1. Go to your state's business registry:
   - **Michigan**: [LARA](https://onecorp.lara.state.mi.us)
   - **California**: [Secretary of State](https://bpd.sos.ca.gov/)
   - **New York**: [Department of State](https://www.dos.ny.gov/business-services/)
   - **Other**: Google `[YOUR STATE] LLC registration online`

2. Search existing businesses
3. If name is available, proceed. If taken, try variations.

### Naming Strategy

✅ **Good names**:
- `AlertShield, LLC`
- `PeakCapital, LLC`
- `StreamSync, LLC`

❌ **Avoid**:
- Too trendy (dates quickly)
- Impossible to spell
- Generic (won't stand out)
- Too narrow (limits expansion)

## Step 5: Business Bank Account

### Why Separate?

Keeping business and personal finances separate:

- Easier accounting

### Opening an Account

**What you'll need**:
- Articles of Organization (from Step 2)
- EIN Letter (from Step 3)
- Your ID
- Initial deposit ($0-100 depending on bank)

**Recommended banks** (low fees, online):
- **Mercury**: Startup-friendly, no minimum balance
- **Brex**: Great if you'll use business credit
- **Chase**: Good local option if you have existing account
- **Your local bank**: Simple and familiar

**Process**:
1. Choose bank
2. Apply online or visit branch
3. Provide documents above
4. Get account number and routing number
5. Set up transfers from personal account

## Step 6: Operating Agreement (Recommended)

### What is it?

Document that outlines how your LLC operates—internal rules for yourself (or co-members if team).

**Required?** Varies by state, but highly recommended.

### What to Include

For solo founder:
- Operating procedures
- Member rights
- Profit/loss distribution (100% to you)
- Meeting requirements (none, since solo)
- Amendment procedures

### Template

Download from your state's SBA office or use a template. For solo LLC, this is usually a simple 1-2 page document.

**Pro tip**: Keep this on file but don't overthink it for a solo founder.

## Step 7: Ongoing Compliance

### Annual Filings

Most states require annual reports:
- **Cost**: $0-50/year
