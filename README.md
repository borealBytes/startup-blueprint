your-company/
├── docs/           # Business docs, policies, contracts
├── website/        # Your public site (auto-deploys)
├── .crewai/        # AI review agents (free)

└── operations/     # Playbooks, checklists, SOPs
```

- **Zero Downtime:** Cloudflare handles failover

### 6. Payment Processing & Invoicing

**We recommend [Helcim](https://www.helcim.com/)** - significantly cheaper than Stripe:

#### Why Helcim?

**Pricing Model:**
- **Interchange-Plus Pricing:** You pay the true wholesale cost + a small transparent margin
- **Online Transactions:** Interchange + 0.50% + 25¢ (vs Stripe's 2.9% + 30¢)
- **In-Person:** Interchange + 0.40% + 8¢ (vs Stripe's 2.7% + 5¢)
- **ACH/Bank Transfers:** 0.5% + 25¢ (vs Stripe's 0.8% capped at $5)

**No Monthly Fees:**
- ✅ $0 monthly fee
- ✅ $0 setup fee
- ✅ $0 PCI compliance fee
- ✅ $0 cancellation fee

**What's Included (No Extra Charge):**
- ✅ Invoicing (unlimited)
- ✅ Recurring billing
- ✅ Virtual terminal
- ✅ Customer management
- ✅ Reporting & analytics
- ✅ Multiple payment methods (credit, debit, ACH)

#### Cost Comparison: Helcim vs Stripe

**Example: $10,000/month in online payments**

| Provider | Pricing | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|----------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Stripe** | 2.9% + 30¢ | ~$320 | ~$3,840 |
| **Helcim** | Interchange + 0.5% + 25¢ (avg 2.49% total) | ~$220 | ~$2,640 |
| **Savings** | - | **$100/mo** | **$1,200/yr** |

*Average assumes typical interchange rate of ~1.99% for Visa/Mastercard*

**Key Advantages:**
1. **~40% lower fees** than Stripe for most transactions
2. **Transparent pricing** (see exact interchange cost)
3. **Scales down as you grow** (automatic volume discounts)
4. **No monthly fees** (perfect for new businesses with low volume)
5. **All features included** (invoicing, ACH, reporting)

**When Helcim Saves the Most:**
- Lower-cost items (interchange-plus beats flat-rate)
- High volume ($50K+/month = even lower rates)
- Mix of payment types (credit, ACH, invoices)
- B2B businesses (ACH is much cheaper)

## 🎯 The Anti-Subscription Philosophy

### Why Monthly Fees Are a Trap
1. **Adds up fast:** $20/mo × 10 services = $200/mo = $2,400/year
2. **Vendor lock-in:** Hard to leave once you're dependent
3. **Price increases:** They always raise prices after you're hooked
4. **Zombie subscriptions:** How many do you forget to cancel?
5. **Cash flow drain:** Recurring charges hurt early-stage businesses

### Our Alternative
- **Pay once, own forever:** LLC + domain = yours for 10+ years
- **Free tiers that work:** GitHub, Cloudflare, Gmail aren't tricks
- **Pay-per-use:** Helcim (interchange-plus), OpenRouter (per request)
- **No vendor lock-in:** Everything is open-source or exportable
- **Cashflow friendly:** $150 upfront, then pay only for actual usage

### When To Actually Pay (We're Honest)

We're not dogmatic. Pay for value when it makes sense:

**Pay-Per-Transaction (Good):**
- **Helcim fees:** Interchange + 0.5% + 25¢ (only when you make sales)
- **OpenAI API:** If you need GPT-4 (but try free models first)

**Monthly Subscriptions (Only If Necessary):**
- **GitHub Teams:** If you need advanced features ($4/user/month, but start free)
- **Cloudflare Pro:** If you outgrow free tier ($20/mo, but most don't need it)
- **Accounting software:** Only if Helcim's built-in invoicing isn't enough

**Never Pay Monthly For:**
- ❌ Website hosting (use Cloudflare Pages free tier)
- ❌ Email hosting (use Gmail forwarding free)
- ❌ Project management (use GitHub Projects free)
- ❌ Documentation hosting (use your monorepo)
- ❌ Basic payment processing (Helcim has $0 monthly fee)
