# 🚀 Startup Blueprint
## The AI-Native Way to Start Your Business

**From idea to deployed business in $150 or less. Everything automated. AI-powered from day one.**

This is not just another business guide. This is **the new way to work**—where your entire business lives in a monorepo, AI agents handle code reviews, and you deploy automatically with every change. Professional infrastructure that scales from solo founder to team, without the complexity.

> **🎯 For:** Founders who want to build an AI-native company without decision paralysis

## 💰 The Complete Cost Breakdown

| Item | Cost | One-Time/Recurring | Required? |
|------|------|-------------------|--------|
| **LLC Registration** | $50-125 | One-time | ✅ Yes |
| **Domain (10 years)** | ~$100-140 | One-time* | ✅ Yes |
| **Gmail** | $0 | Free | ✅ Yes |
| **GitHub** | $0 | Free (private repos) | ✅ Yes |
| **Cloudflare** | $0 | Free (Pages + Workers) | ✅ Yes |
| **Perplexity AI** | $0 | Free tier | ✅ Yes |
| **OpenRouter AI** | ~$0.01/month | Pay-per-use | ✅ Yes |
| **CrewAI Reviews** | <$0.01/PR | Pay-per-use | ✅ Yes |
| **Everything Else** | $0 | Free | ✅ Yes |

**Total Startup Cost: $150-265 (one-time)**

*Why 10 years upfront? Domain recovery fees ($100-500) if you forget to renew are more expensive than prepaying. Set it and forget it.

**Ongoing: ~$0.02/month** (AI usage only—everything else is free)

## 🤖 What Makes This AI-Native?

### Your Entire Business in One Monorepo

Forget scattered tools and lost documents. Everything lives in your private GitHub repository:

```
your-company/
├── docs/           # Business docs, policies, contracts
├── website/        # Your public site (auto-deploys)
├── .crewai/        # AI review agents
├── .perplexity/    # AI workspace instructions
└── operations/     # Playbooks, checklists, SOPs
```

**One repo. One source of truth. Fully version controlled.**

### AI Agents That Actually Work

1. **Perplexity AI Spaces** — Your AI assistant knows your exact business context
2. **OpenRouter** — Sub-penny AI inference for automation
3. **CrewAI Reviews** — Free automated code review on every PR (<$0.01 per review)
4. **GitHub Actions** — Auto-deploy on merge, no manual steps

### The New Way to Work

**Traditional:**
- Scattered Google Docs
- Email-based communication
- Manual deployments
- Hours spent on repetitive tasks
- Decision fatigue on every tool choice

**AI-Native (This Blueprint):**
- Everything in Git (searchable, versioned, backed up)
- Async collaboration via PRs with AI review
- Automatic deployments (commit = deploy)
- AI handles code review, testing, documentation
- Decisions already made—just follow the blueprint

## 🎯 Why This Approach?

### Eliminate Decision Paralysis

Starting a business involves **thousands of micro-decisions**:
- What legal structure? (We chose LLC)
- Which email provider? (Gmail + Cloudflare routing)
- What domain registrar? (Cloudflare—cost-only pricing)
- How to host a website? (Cloudflare Pages—free)
- Which bank? (Fidelity—no fees, great service)
- What accounting software? (Wave—free, or Stripe)
- How to manage code? (GitHub—industry standard)
- Which AI tools? (Perplexity + OpenRouter + CrewAI)

**We made all these decisions for you.** Based on cost, reliability, scalability, and integration. You can change them, but you don't have to decide from scratch.

### Start AI-Native

Most companies add AI **after** they're established. That's backward.

With this blueprint:
- **Your business is AI-aware from day one**
- Processes are documented for AI to learn
- Everything in Git means AI can reference your entire context
- Automation is built in, not bolted on

### Monorepo Structure

Your entire business in one repository:
- **Searchable:** Find anything with `git grep` or GitHub search
- **Versioned:** See who changed what and when
- **Backed up:** Git is distributed—you have copies
- **Collaborative:** PRs for proposals, reviews, and discussions
- **Private:** Only you and your team can see it

No more:
- "Where did we put that contract?"
- "Which Google Doc has the latest version?"
- "Who approved this change?"

### Scale Without Rework

This infrastructure supports:
- **Solo founder** → Works perfectly
- **2-3 co-founders** → Add them to GitHub, done
- **5-10 person team** → Same processes, more collaborators
- **Remote team** → Async collaboration via PRs

You won't need to "rebuild your infrastructure" at 5 people, 10 people, or 50 people.

## 🎓 Core Principles

### 1. AI-Native First
Don't add AI later. Build with AI from the start. Your processes should be AI-readable, your documentation should be AI-accessible, your workflows should be AI-compatible.

### 2. Everything in Git
Your entire business lives in version control. Documents, code, processes, contracts—everything. Searchable. Versioned. Backed up. Collaborative.

### 3. Automate Everything
Manual deployments? No. Manual testing? No. Manual reviews? No. If it can be automated, automate it. AI handles repetitive tasks.

### 4. Professional from Day One
Your setup should look like a 100-person company from the start. Custom domain email. Proper legal structure. Automated CI/CD. Professional communication.

### 5. Minimal Cost, Maximum Value
Most services are free. Total startup cost is government fees + domain registration. No expensive subscriptions. No vendor lock-in.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: Basic Git knowledge helps, but most guides are copy-paste. If you can follow step-by-step instructions, you're good.

**Q: What if I want to use different tools?**
A: Go for it! The processes are tool-agnostic. Adapt the guides to your preferences.

**Q: Is this only for US companies?**
A: The legal section is US-focused (LLC registration), but everything else works globally. Adapt the legal guide to your jurisdiction.

**Q: Can I do this solo?**
A: Yes! The entire blueprint assumes a solo founder. Team features are optional.

**Q: What if I'm non-technical?**
A: You'll need to learn some Git basics, but we provide guides. Alternatively, partner with a technical co-founder.

**Q: Why prepay for 10 years of domain?**
A: Domain recovery fees ($100-500) if you forget to renew are more expensive than prepaying (~$100-140 for 10 years). Set it and forget it.

**Q: What if AI costs more than expected?**
A: OpenRouter and CrewAI usage is pay-per-use and extremely cheap (<$0.01/month typical). If you scale massively, costs scale proportionally with value.

**Q: Can I upgrade individual services later?**
A: Yes! Start free, upgrade as needed. GitHub Pro, Perplexity Pro, etc. are all optional.
