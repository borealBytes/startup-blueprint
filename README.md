*Why 10 years upfront? Domain recovery fees ($100-500) if you forget to renew are more expensive than prepaying. Set it and forget it.

**Ongoing: ~$0.02/month** (AI usage only—everything else is free)

## 🤖 What Makes This AI-Native?

### Your Entire Business in One Monorepo

Forget scattered tools and lost documents. Everything lives in your private GitHub repository:

```
your-company/
├── docs/           # Business docs, policies, contracts
├── website/        # Your public site (auto-deploys)
├── .crewai/        # AI review agents
├── .perplexity/    # AI workspace instructions
└── operations/     # Playbooks, checklists, SOPs
```

**One repo. One source of truth. Fully version controlled.**

### AI Agents That Actually Work

1. **Perplexity AI Spaces** — Your AI assistant knows your exact business context
2. **OpenRouter** — Sub-penny AI inference for automation
3. **CrewAI Reviews** — Free automated code review on every PR (<$0.01 per review)
4. **GitHub Actions** — Auto-deploy on merge, no manual steps

### The New Way to Work

**Traditional:**
- Scattered Google Docs
- Email-based communication
- Manual deployments
- Hours spent on repetitive tasks
- Decision fatigue on every tool choice

**AI-Native (This Blueprint):**
- Everything in Git (searchable, versioned, backed up)
- Async collaboration via PRs with AI review
- Automatic deployments (commit = deploy)
- AI handles code review, testing, documentation
- Decisions already made—just follow the blueprint
