## 🎯 The Anti-Subscription Philosophy

### Why Monthly Fees Are a Trap
1. **Adds up fast:** $20/mo × 10 services = $200/mo = $2,400/year
2. **Vendor lock-in:** Hard to leave once you're dependent
3. **Price increases:** They always raise prices after you're hooked
4. **Zombie subscriptions:** How many do you forget to cancel?
5. **Cash flow drain:** Recurring charges hurt early-stage businesses

### Our Alternative
- **Pay once, own forever:** LLC + domain = yours for 10+ years
- **Free tiers that work:** GitHub, Cloudflare, Gmail aren't tricks
- **Pay-per-use AI:** OpenRouter charges per request (pennies)
- **No vendor lock-in:** Everything is open-source or exportable
- **Cashflow friendly:** $150 upfront, then basically free

### When To Actually Pay Monthly
We're not dogmatic. Pay for value:
- **Stripe fees:** 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction (industry standard)
- **OpenAI API:** If you need GPT-4 (but try free models first)
- **GitHub Teams:** If you need advanced features (start free)
- **Cloudflare Pro:** If you outgrow free tier (most don't)

But avoid:
- ❌ Website hosting (use Cloudflare Pages)
- ❌ Email hosting (use Gmail forwarding)
- ❌ Project management (use GitHub Projects)
- ❌ Documentation hosting (use your monorepo)
