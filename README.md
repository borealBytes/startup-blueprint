## 🎯 The Anti-Subscription Philosophy

### Why Monthly Fees Are a Trap

1. **Adds up fast:** $20/mo × 10 services = $200/mo = $2,400/year
2. **Vendor lock-in:** Hard to leave once you're dependent
3. **Price increases:** They always raise prices after you're hooked
4. **Zombie subscriptions:** How many do you forget to cancel?
5. **Cash flow drain:** Recurring charges hurt early-stage businesses

### Our Alternative

- **Pay once, own forever:** LLC + domain = yours for 10+ years
- **Free tiers that work:** GitHub, Cloudflare, Gmail aren't tricks
- **Pay-per-use:** Helcim (interchange-plus), OpenRouter (per request)
- **No vendor lock-in:** Everything is open-source or exportable
- **Cashflow friendly:** $150 upfront, then pay only for actual usage

### When To Actually Pay (We're Honest)

We're not dogmatic. Pay for value when it makes sense:

**Pay-Per-Transaction (Good):**

- **Helcim fees:** 2.55%-2.97% + fees (only when you make sales)
- **OpenAI API:** If you need GPT-4 (but try free models first)

**Monthly Subscriptions (Only If Necessary):**

- **GitHub Teams:** If you need advanced features ($4/user/month, but start free)
- **Cloudflare Pro:** If you outgrow free tier ($20/mo, but most don't need it)
- **Accounting software:** Only if Helcim's built-in invoicing isn't enough

**Never Pay Monthly For:**

- ❌ Website hosting (use Cloudflare Pages free tier)
- ❌ Email hosting (use Gmail forwarding free)
- ❌ Project management (use GitHub Projects free)
- ❌ Documentation hosting (use your monorepo)
- ❌ Basic payment processing (Helcim has $0 monthly fee)
- ❌ Business banking (Fidelity has $0 monthly fee)
